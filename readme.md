# Module9 Challenge: Readme Generator

## Description

The goal of this challenge was to use node/javascript to create a command line application that will prompt the user for questions on their project repository and automatically generate a professional readme file with license information, table of contents and contact information.

## Tasks Accomplished

<ul>
    <li>Used inquirer to prompt users for information about their project/repository</li>
    <li>Used the node file system to save the text generated by the script to a readme file</li>
    <li>Used node to separate the functions of the application into two separate js scripts, one to prompt the user for information and create the readme file and one to generate the readme text.</li>
</ul>

## Application Readme

Running the application using node index.js will prompt the user for questions and after all input is complete, the generated readme file will be created in the render folder. A sample readme that was generated using this app has been included in the render folder: [sampleReadme](./render/sampleReadme.md)
